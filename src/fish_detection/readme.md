# fish detection with groundingDino

## install
1. run pip install requirements.txt
2. run sh setup.sh

this SHOULD work. If you use CUDA it might be more tricky, but I have no time to look into that right now :/

## run 
fish_detection_main.py currently takes one image (input/photo.png) and runs the fish locator on it. 
The functions can all be found in fish_detection.py.
I did not add it to main.py yet but it should (hopefully) be (relatively) straight forward.
